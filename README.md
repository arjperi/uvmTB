# Bare Bone UVM TB
Bare Bone test bench for an addsub hardware unit.

AddSub unit dut code is from [opencores](https://opencores.org/projects/fixed_point_arithmetic_parameterized).

I can provide a makefile for VCS on request.
The target audience is anyone try to learn UVM or create a TB from scratch. 

This smaller TB can be used to run experiments or proof of concepts that you may want to implement in your own TB.
