# Bare Bone UVM TB
Bare Bone test bench for an addsub hardware unit.

AddSub unit dut code is from [opencores](https://opencores.org/projects/fixed_point_arithmetic_parameterized).

The target audience is anyone try to learn UVM or create a TB from scratch. 

This smaller TB can be used to run experiments or proof of concepts that you may want to implement in your own TB. The following figure shows how the TB is organized
